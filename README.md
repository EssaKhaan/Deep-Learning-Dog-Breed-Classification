# Deep-Learning-Dog-Breed-Classification
## This google colab notebook is an end-to-end multiclass dog breed identification problem.

## Data Source:  https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/Data

## TensorFlow 2.0, Keras, TensorFlow Hub:
The model is build using Deep Learning/Transfer Learning with the help of TensorFlow 2.0, Keras and TensorFlow Hub. Model is trained on 120 breeds of dogs. It can give you the breed of the dog. You can also upload your custom images of any dog (within 120 breeds on which it is trained on) and It will give you the breed to which the dog belongs.

## TensorBoard logs:
Tensorboard extension is used to save the logs of the model.

## Callback:
Earlystopping callback is used in this notebook to prevent the model from overfitting.

## Model:
A full blown dog breed identifier model(trained on 10000 images) is saved in .h5 file that can identify the dog breed
