# Deep-Learning-Dog-Breed-Classification
This google colab notebook is an end-to-end multiclass dog breed identification problem.

## Data Source:  https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/Data

## The model is build using Deep Learning/Transfer Learning with the help of TensorFlow 2.0, Keras and TensorFlow Hub. Model is trained on 120 breeds of dogs. It can give you the breed of the dog. You can also upload your custom images of any dog (within 120 breeds on which it is trained on) and It will give you the breed to which the dog belongs.
